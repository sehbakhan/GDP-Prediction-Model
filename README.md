1. **Data Preprocessing**
    - **Handle missing values, if any, by imputation or removal.**
    - **Encode categorical variables (e.g., Country).**
    - **Scale numerical features like Population, Life Expectancy, and Unemployment Rate (%) for model compatibility.**
    - **Split the data into training and testing sets.**
  
      
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
    - **Analyze relationships between GDP and other indicators.**
    - **Visualize key insights using scatter plots and correlation matrices to understand feature interactions and importance.**

3. **Model Selection**
    - **Consider regression models such as Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, and Gradient Boosting Regressor to predict GDP.**
    - **Evaluate models using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared metrics.**
    - **Choose the model with the best predictive performance.**
  
      
4. **Model Training and Hyperparameter Tuning**
    - **Train the selected model on the training data.**
    - **Perform hyperparameter tuning using cross-validation techniques.**
  
      
5. **Interpret Model Results**
    - **Analyze feature importance to identify the socioeconomic indicators with the most significant impact on GDP.**
    - **Present insights from the model, such as the effect of unemployment rate or access to electricity on GDP.**
